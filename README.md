# Allome<sup>速</sup>: A Quantum Graph Approached Smart AQPUs.


### Allome<sup>速</sup>, is a smart quantum graph approached processing units, which can be trained via each and every matrix units and all training resided inside coupling parallel direct access memory.

This Allome<sup>速</sup> can be editable only with de-writing algorithm(s), if allowed at some encryption level of privilege(s). This operations abide by overriding principle designed for Allome and kept inside that and allowed only by Attorney, when it adding a rule of FIR. 

As of now, The Allome<sup>速</sup>, is a AQPU - All Quantum Processing Units, can de defined as all operations which can deal at quantum level with the help of without ROM and RAM, even caching with.
